            I loved exploring the cute industrial city of Galway, located about 3 hours away from Dublin. Galway is known for its vibrant arts scene, lively music, and charming medieval architecture. I spent my time wandering the winding streets, popping into local shops and pubs, and enjoying the lively atmosphere. 
        <p> 
            My favorite places included Eyre Square, John F. Kennedy Memorial Park, the Waterway Trails, and Galway's Cathedral.
            The city involved a great amount and balance of city like ambiance and natural scenery. I found the people to be incredibly friendly and welcoming, and I enjoyed the lively music scene and local pubs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also enjoyed visiting Galway's Computer and Communications Museum, where I learned more about the city's tech and innovation scene. The museum had fascinating exhibits on the history of computing and telecommunications in Ireland and worldwide. I also loved spending time playing with the vintage computers and video games on display, particularly PacMan. 
        </p>
            Overall, Galway was a highlight of my study abroad journey in Ireland. The city's charming atmosphere, rich history, and welcoming locals made it a truly memorable experience.
            The city is full of charming pubs, lively music, and friendly locals. I had a wonderful time exploring the unique culture and history of this vibrant city.
        </p>
            
            The city's location on the coast also makes it a great base for exploring the nearby Cliffs of Moher, which we will discuss on another page <a href="https://maferraz21.github.io/ireland/cliffs.html"> here</a>!
