        <h2>Day 1: Howth & Great food</h2>
        <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 6, 2024</time>
        <p>
            On my first day in Dublin, we explored the beautiful neighborhood of Howth. Our journey began with a visit to the breathtaking Howth Head Peak, surrounded by lush greenery. After soaking in the natural beauty, we indulged in a delightful lunch at Crabby Jo's, a charming restaurant nestled in Howth's harbor. I savored the delicious Baked Salmon Darne accompanied by saut√©ed mushrooms and onions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following lunch, we returned to our hotel where I took some time to settle in before embarking on an exploration of the local streets, immersing myself in the vibrant atmosphere. For dinner, we dined at The Brazen Head, Dublin's oldest pub. I couldn't resist trying the mussels, and they were absolutely delicious!

        <h2>Day 2: Dublin Bus Tour</h2>
        <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024</time>
        <p>Day two in Dublin unfolded as a captivating journey through the city's rich tapestry of history and culture. Embarking on a guided bus tour, we immersed ourselves in the stories of Dublin's past and present.</p>
        
        <p>Our journey kicked off with a visit to the solemn Famine Memorial, a touching tribute to those who faced unimaginable hardship during Ireland's Great Famine. As I stood among the haunting sculptures, I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of respect for the resilience and strength of the Irish people.

        <p>As we continued our adventure, we found ourselves at the legendary General Post Office (GPO). This place isn't just a building; it's a piece of history, filled with stories of rebellion and resilience. Standing in front of its impressive architecture, we couldn't help but feel a sense of awe. Learning about its past, we gained a deeper appreciation for the determination of the Irish people. And right outside, we encountered the Spear of the Nation, a powerful reminder of Ireland's fight for freedom.

        <h2>Day 4: Guest Lecture with Dr David Williams - Gamificaiton, Engagement, and Accessibility </h2>
        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 9, 2024</time>
        <p> In this lecture, we delved into the captivating realm of gamification, exploring how game elements can transform ordinary tasks into engaging experiences. This transformative process encompasses a myriad of elements including challenges, social interaction, immersion, goal orientation, feedback mechanisms, progression, and playfulness. The discussion extended to the frameworks of MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics) and MDAO (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics, and Outcomes), highlighting the dynamic nature of user behavior and the unforeseen outcomes that often arise. Finding the delicate balance between providing autonomy and maintaining control emerged as a central challenge in designing gamified experiences. Games are meticulously crafted to captivate and immerse players in rich environments, a feat not easily replicated in educational settings. However, our lecturer emphasized that understanding user behavior and needs is key to fostering engagement. Through meticulous analysis and mapping of mechanisms, he outlined strategies for applying gamification principles to learning environments. The concept of engagement was dissected, revealing its multifaceted nature often intertwined with participation, goals, motivation, immersion, drive, and flow. Drawing from research, we explored engagement in technology, defined by a rich array of attributes including challenge, positive affect, aesthetic appeal, attention, interactivity, and perceived user control. One of the pivotal discussions centered around the measurement of engagement, which encompasses dimensions such as skills development, participation and interaction levels, emotional responses, and performance outcomes. Additionally, accessibility emerged as a critical consideration, emphasizing the importance of creating inclusive experiences that accommodate diverse user needs. As we navigate the evolving landscape of gamification and user engagement, these insights serve as guiding beacons, illuminating pathways toward creating more immersive, meaningful, and inclusive experiences for all. </p>

        <h2> Day 5: EPIC Museum </h2>
        <time datetime="2024-05-10">May 10, 2024</time>
        <p> In my first Friday in Dublin, I started out the day with class then in the afternoon headed to the EPIC Museum, The Irish Immigration Museum on the North side of the city. This museum had 20 different rooms, each showing a different part of Irish culture: art, music, food, and its history/global connection.  </p>
